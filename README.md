# 32hertz


This is the code for <a title="32hertz.com" href="http://32hertz.com/"><strong>32hertz.com</a></strong>. It is a <strong>WordPress</strong> website that uses a <strong>responsive theme</strong> that I built from scratch. It uses <strong>Bootstrap 3</strong>. The simplicity of the theme allows me the freedom to create any kind of page that I want.
